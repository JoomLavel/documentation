## Why this platform?

We noticed that many web developers start a projects on Joomla (one of tht most popular CMS), but then reach limitations of this platform. Our concept is to build platform to easy enhance Joomla with Laravel, which allows to do a lot more.
We offer a system that has no such limitations, is universal and even allows to integrate already existing software or internet services.
